# Magic Switchboard
A magic schwitchboard is a little box with four switches and four lamps colored in red, green, blue and yellow.
The switches have got hats in the same colors. You can change the position of the lamps and the hats in any way you want.
But the red switch always lights the red lamp, the blue the blue, the yellow the yellow and the green the green one.
How does this work?
The magician is the one operating the switchbox. He has to remember which switch was turned off last. 
He then hands off the box to the audience and asks them to rearrange the colors.
When the audience returns his box he remembers the sequence in which the lights turn on and turns the switches with matching color.
For the audience it seems like the colors are connected somehow.
